# Voxelizer Playground
Just a playground for me to learn how to take things and convert them to voxels.  
Maybe I'll even do something _cool_ with the voxels.

## Setup
To set up the project run the following.
```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script
This project is hacked together, so I can't (or won't) guarantee anything will work if it deviates at all.  

_From the project's root directory_ run `python3 main.py`. You should get a window that displays whatever final product I decide to leave here.

## Demos
### Voxelizing a simple SDF and rendering voxels as points
